## 🧭 Overview

**AeroTune** is a data-driven FPV tuning tool that analyzes Betaflight Blackbox logs and returns **conservative, real-world PID adjustments** based on actual flight behavior.

It is designed to:
- Detect oscillations and noise patterns  
- Evaluate tracking performance (gyro vs setpoint)  
- Recommend safe percentage changes for **P, I, D, and Feed Forward**  
- Align with real Betaflight tuning principles  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **CSV Blackbox Log Analysis**
- 🧠 **Automatic Issue Detection**
- 🎯 **3 Pilot Goals**
  - Efficient (safe + smooth)
  - Locked-In (sharp + responsive)
  - Floaty (cinematic + soft)
- 📈 **Frequency + Tracking Analysis**
- 🛡️ **Log Validation + Quality Score**
- 🔧 **Real PID % Deltas (not fake numbers)**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

```text
Flight → Blackbox Log → CSV → AeroTune → PID Recommendations
```

AeroTune analyzes:
- Gyro frequency content (FFT)
- Tracking correlation
- Response lag
- Error ratio

Then applies Betaflight-based tuning logic:
- **P** → tracking strength  
- **I** → hold / drift correction  
- **D** → damping / propwash control  
- **FF** → stick responsiveness

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This tool provides **conservative tuning guidance**, not aggressive presets  
- Always test changes incrementally  
- Monitor **motor temperatures when increasing D**  
- Log quality directly affects accuracy  

---

## 🎯 Goal Philosophy

- **Efficient** → safer, cooler, smoother  
- **Locked-In** → tighter tracking, sharper feel  
- **Floaty** → softer, cinematic movement  

---

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] Live log preview graphs  
- [ ] Auto log scoring UI display  
- [ ] PID profile export  
- [ ] Mobile app version

## 🚀 Final Note

AeroTune is built to bridge the gap between **raw Blackbox data** and **real tuning decisions**.

> Not guesses. Not presets.  
> Just data → analysis → results.
